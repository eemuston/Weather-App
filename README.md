<h1>Weather App</h1>
<br>
A simple weather application that provides real-time weather information. It uses data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays weather details with intuitive images to represent different weather conditions.
<br>

- Search by City: Users can search for weather information for any city.

<br>
The default page shows three of my favourite cities. (Yes, every one of them had the same temperature at the time.)
